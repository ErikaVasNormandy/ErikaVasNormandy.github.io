  	<h1>Gabriella "Gabby" MacAlastair</h1>
    <p>Age</p>
    <p>    "Roles": "DPS, option for ranged offense when Jarvis is on the same team to provide technical support",
    "tldr": "As the Ananke's hot-headed DPS, \"Gabs\" is the teams front-point offense with a penchant for bluntness and a quick temper. <br/><br/>Gabby takes her Atomancer responsibilities very seriously in spite of her flippant regard for the overly complex politics and dreary realities of both the Atomcraft Magnate and the world of the non-users.",

    "Goals": "To have a family to come home to",
    "Background": "As the crew's primary damage dealer, Gabriella is an expert at Reinforcement Sorcery and has been sighted using this skillset to deal tremendous damage and move with incredible speed even for a trained Atomancer. According to MacAlastair Orphanage records, she was found on 42nd Street in Avonbury's East End, likely between ages 5-8 according to the coroners who found her in sooty clothes and what appeared to be physical blows along the face and throat. Though there had been reports of a gas pipe explosion in that district some hours earlier, the foundling would not respond to inquiries ",
    "CurrentStatus": "Alive, doing various odd jobs and contract work as a Tier 2 Atomancer as well as mercenary work",</p>
