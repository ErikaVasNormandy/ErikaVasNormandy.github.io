    "PreviewPic": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/scavengers-repo.com/tab-worldbuilding-characters/Vol-Spring/JarvisHopperLong.png",
    "Roles": "Support, Tank when operating the Ananke",
    "tldr": "Technomancer and resident mechanic aboard the Ananke",
    "Priority": 3,
    "Alignment": "Neutral Good",
    "Childhood": "Only child in a working-class household. Jarvis had a decent childhood growing up in the mechanic shop his father worked in. His mother died when he was very young, and attempts to identify her for any lineage have turned up null. Either way, Jarvis displayed no outward signs of Atomcraft capability until age 12, having miraculously survived a factory accident that his father did not.",
    "Age": "21",
    "Goals": "To run a machine shop for building airship parts and trading pulp magazines. Being an Atomancer suits him quite well since he likes working with Atomcraft tech",
    "Background": "Low-tier Atomancer operating within the airspace of the Avonbury sector since 107 NE (New Era). Companions often refer to him as \"Hopper\", although records from the MacAlastair Orphan Foundation confirm his name to be Jarvis Long, that he had grown up within Avonbury's Oriental enclave, and that he began Atomancer work at around age 12 after his father's death. According to handlers and instructors, Hopper showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical engineering despite poor academic performance. He also showed some promise in flight maneuvering with medium-sized vessels. <br/><br/>Hopper's specialty is building and repairing mechanical devices, whether normal or Atomcrafted. His portfolio includes: Astral Consoles, drones (small and medium civilian and military-grade), ACPA units, small to medium air vessels, and bots. His physical abilities without reinforcement circuitry are average, but witnesses claim he may have severe vision impairment after the events of the Cerenian Incident. Whether he has found a way to correct this biologically is unknown, but was last seen with VR Augmentation lenses. <br/><br/><strong>Contacts <\/strong><br/><br/>Xander Rozycki: Supposedly gave Jarvis the nickname \"Hopper\" due to his skittishness around Atomancers at an early age. Given the age and experience difference, Jarvis looks up to Xander as both a mentor and a friend. It is unknown if they have maintained these relations after the group split up over the Cerenian Incident<br/><br/>Gabriella MacAlastair: Get along \"like a house on fire\". Out of the four-man team that comprised the first batch of Foundation Atomancers, only Gabby appears to maintain contact, as job registries and contract records seem to suggest. A comment describes them often \"thinking in-step\"; this is likely an attribute of residual mem-linking circuits the Department of Voidspace Flotsam failed to confiscate.",
