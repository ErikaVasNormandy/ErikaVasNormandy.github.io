This is akin to the way people talk about \"The Good Old Days\" without remembering or acknowledging the problems the past might have created or had to deal with. The Victorians began this with Medieval Revivalism, by romanticizing past heroes in ways that they themselves would not recognize.<\/p>\n<br/>\n\n<h3>Naive Newcomer Must Save the World<\/h3>\n<p>Luke finds he\u2019s the son of a Jedi and can use the Force. Neo discovers he\u2019s the One and must join a resistance to free humanity from the Machines. Harry gets a letter from Hogwarts and will coincidentally play a major role in the fate of the Magical World. Desmond Miles discovers his Assassin heritage and the thousand year-long conflict between the Assassins and Templars. This is the fantasy that every reader has, to discover a fantastical world just below the mundane real one. Moreover, we all want to be someone important in this Otherworld, or at least play a role in the events that take place in it. The average person in Arda Hyperion is a civilian, a non-inherent user of Atomcraft, and still has to do the same kind of boring drudgery we would do, except with paranormal, fantastical conspiracies and monsters going on under your nose. <\/p>\n<br/>\n\n <h3>An Unmasqued World<\/h3>\n<p>The Atomancer World consists of daemonic, cosmic entities, occultist objects, archaeotech, and validation that mythical and historical figures existed. Also, mystical weapons, post-modern magic (you can be a matter-bender, energy-bender, or a time-bender! Except not really and maybe 1 or 2 people can affect time), and moar archaeotech. <\/p>\n<br/>\n\n <h3>Can One Person Make a Difference?<\/h3>\n<p>So you found you\u2019re a Jedi/Wizard/Assassin/Bender/Mutant/Alien/etc. Would you use your \u2018powers\u2019 to do good? Or would having these powers that make you unique even make a difference to an uncaring and mundane reality?<\/p>\n<br/>\n\n\n <h3>Distance of Space and Time<\/h3>\n<p>Our predecessors and ancestors would be completely alien to us. Their world was entirely different from ours and if they met us today, it would be like encountering a completely different type of people<\/p>\n<br/>\n\n <h3>Does the World Really Need Metahuman Individuals?<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone wants a world where they are the ones who are involved with whatever conspiracies are actually going on.  This authority or group of individuals is usually exempt from the law, or exists outside of the normal bureaucratic institutions of our reality. No one wants to be an ordinary Muggle who gets caught in the crossfire on an unlucky day. But this fantasy for an external force of supernatural people is a dangerous one to even aspire to since it will always devolve into a class system where hostilities are just around the corner.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, would you be able to live within two worlds at the same time?<\/p>\n<br/>\n\n <h3>Childish Idealism, Magic, and Technology<\/h3>\n<p>Magic won\u2019t solve your problems, or the world\u2019s. Especially if it\u2019s limited to just a few group of people. The same goes for any kind of \u2018Advanced Technology\u2019 . Technological progress can be a good thing, but when mismanaged it can create many more problems than it solves.<\/p><br/>\n</p>
