  <div id="1" class="bookpage">
    <p>On the road of making Scavengers-Repo, I figured it would be interesting to actually see just how secure the site was. Usually vulnerabilities are a byproduct of mistakes on the developer's part, and since I was the time-crunched developer, security took second priority over production </p>
    <p>Used this site: <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/learn/penetration-testing-your-wordpress-website/"></a> to get started on some of the basic steps of securing your own web application.  </p>
    <p>There are 4 steps they outline:
      <ol>
        <li>Reconaissance</li>
        <li>Scanning</li>
        <li>Exploitation</li>
        <li>Mitigation</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, it's very comprehensive and hands-on without too much jargon. I used their steps as a guideline to scan my own site.

    </p>

    <p>
      So with that said, let's get started on some Reconaissance!
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 3em;">1. Reconaissance</h2>
    <p>What can we do with a <strong>Terminal</strong> and a <strong>url</strong>?</p>
    <p><strong><img style="width: 70%; float: right;" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/scavengers-repo.com/images/Sketches/NSLookup.png"></strong></p>
  </div>



  <div id="2" class="bookpage">
    <p><strong>>nslookup</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/scavengers-repo.com/staticWebPages/ClickJacking/clickjack0.png"></p>
    <div class="quoteBox">"Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers" <p style="font-size: .8em;">(>man lookup)</p></div>
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>Use this tool to match Internet URL's to their server IP's</p>
    <p>I found a web url, maybe a website that a client wants me to test, and ran <strong>nslookup</strong> on it to get an IP</p>
    <img class= "screenshot" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/scavengers-repo.com/staticWebPages/ClickJacking/clickjack1.png"></img>
    <p>I've also run a <strong>whois</strong> just to see some more (public!) information about the url</p>

    <p>Usually, I would also run an <strong>nmap</strong>scan on the IP we've just found.</p>
      <p> Nmap is a Terminal tool that let's us see the services on a particular address (ergo, what kinds of programs is this machine running?). We might be able to exploit them, such as a web server on port 80 that allows uploading files onto it.

      Since I'm going to be brief, I'll just move on to the Scanning stage to see what we can do with that IP address for this website </p>
  </div>

  <div id ="3" class="bookpage">
    <h2 style="font-size: 3em;">2. Scanning</h2>
    <p>The tutorial in the link says that at this stage, pen-testers use <strong>Fuzzing</strong> on the target. This boils down to sending large amounts of random data to the application</p>
    <p>Hopefully the results will reveal even more information about the target, although this can generate a lot of traffic that an IDS can pick up</p>
      <p>-->How exactly does the application work?</p>

    <p>-->Where did the developer make a mistake?</p>

    <p>The tutorial goes in depth on some available tools, such as SQLMap, WPScan, and Burpsuite.</p>
    <p>For this tutorial, I picked Nikto because it sounded like the least time-consuming with minimal setup </p>

    <p>Well what do you know? the site is on an nginx server, and the developer (me) has not given this site protection against <strong>clickjacking</strong></p>
    <div class="quoteBox">"...The “clickjacking” attack allows an evil page to click on a “victim site” on behalf of the visitor."
    </div>
    https://javascript.info/clickjacking
    <p>This site gives a pretty good demo of how clickjacking works, but the basic gist is that the bad guy places an invisible iframe over a link or a button you intend to click. It's positioned in a way that clicking on the supposed button will actually cause you to click on the invisible iframe's link instead. </p>
