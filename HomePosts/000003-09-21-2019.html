<p>I guess I should be more formal about things but at this point I'm kind of just tired of it all. I guess this is where I'll be putting tweets or however people want to call it.</p>
<p>Well it is officially Day 3 since I missed the flight. I'm still upset over it but I've made my choice and have to live with it. I at least have a "mission" if we want to call it that.
