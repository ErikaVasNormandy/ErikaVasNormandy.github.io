<p>Two more features left to implement, but I'll have to put them on the backburner, at least until I can ace some coding tests. 
I feel like most of my web programming has consisted of plug and play with much 
Google and StackOverflow.</p>
<p>
I'm hoping to make a transition from primarily working in NodeJS and on and off Bash to more Python scripting with network and log analysis. Hopefully I can start working towards an actual security career track before I have kids and have to focus on family. </p> 

<p>On a worldbuilding end... I think the range for approximate time aesthetics would be a blend of traditional medieval fantasy to early 1900s, in the midst of World War I and before all that nonsense with flappers and prohibition. At least until Winter rolls around. </p>


<h6>Some Musings</h6>

<p><code>...Justicars, Wayfinders, Technomancers, Mages: a tentative class structure roughly 
based on roles when working together. In the pre-Crisis era, most Atomancers branched out from 
the Mage role to become Justicars and Technomancers: admired and respected roles in the eyes of
 society and fellow Atomancers. Justicars are typically the only authorized pilots of Vorpaline exosuits and toolkit modules. They were the ones to protect humanity's citadels from the lawless chaos of Voidborne, and are a symbol of an era long-gone where humanity reigned supreme and Atomancers were loved.<\/code>\n<code>Now, many Justicars have gone offline, powering off their Arpanet chips to avoid detection from all but the most determined Magnate inquisitors</code></p>
