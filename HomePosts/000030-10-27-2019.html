WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors have filed multiple charges against a 23-year-old South Korean man accused of running what they call the world's "Largest dark web child porn marketplace."
</p>
<p>The site operated from June 2015 until it was seized and shut down by U.S. authorities in March 2018.At a press conference Wednesday morning, U.S. officials said 337 suspected users of the site had been arrested worldwide to date. The site sought only child sexual abuse imagery, according to prosecutors - its landing page stated in red bold type: "Do not upload adult porn. 
</p>
<p>
A notable moment in the investigation came in September 2017 when an <strong>Internal Revenue Service agent who was assisting with the probe noticed that the site's administrator had misconfigured his site, which revealed his South Korean IP address,</strong> and then ultimately revealed the identity of its owner. During the criminal probe, authorities conducted controlled buys of child porn videos from the site and eventually worked closely with the U.S. attorney's office in D.C. on the investigation. 
</p>

<p>One user, Nicholas Stengel, of Washington, D.C., pleaded guilty to child porn charges late last year and was sentenced to 15 years in prison: prosecutors said that he alone downloaded more than 50 years worth of abuse videos. When they announced the arrest of "Mr. A" in 2018, the South Korean police also said they had arrested a total of 156 South Koreans for either uploading or downloading child porn materials, which was unusual given that the site operated entirely in English.
