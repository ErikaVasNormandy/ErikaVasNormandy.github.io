##Landing Site:

This was pretty easy to make. First I made a repo in github (username.github.io)
2nd: cd into WhiteRabbit
3rd: git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
4th: cd username.github.io
5th: echo "Hello World" > index.html

git add. 
git commit -m " nitial commit"
git push -u origin master
