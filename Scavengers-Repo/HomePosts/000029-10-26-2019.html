On the 13th June 2019, a rocket launched from Kiruna, Sweden, carrying 280kg of scientific experiments; among them, a Raspberry Pi Zero running Docker containers on balenaOS. 

<p>To our knowledge this is the first time a Moby/Docker container engine has been flown to space!
</p>
<p>
 Nico Maas, an IT Engineer & Ground Controller from the Deutsches Zentrum fâ–’r Luft und Raumfahrt, has been working on a project to develop a replacement on-board computer for sounding rockets. 
</p>
</p>These rockets, sometimes alternatively known as research rockets, are designed to carry scientific instruments and other payloads intended to perform experiments and take measurements during a short, sub-orbital flight. 

<p>The Microchip ATmega328 is commonly used in OBCs for this application, and whilst useful for simple applications, more complex projects involving high throughput data sampling and cryptography demand more computational power. </p>

	<p>Nico goes on to explain that the biggest issue encountered with Linux-based single board computers like the Raspberry Pi, in this application, is the reliance upon a high quality power supply which cannot always be guaranteed on-board a flight vehicle. </p>
		<p>The software on the device runs in containers via balenaEngine, an implementation of the Moby/Docker container engine tailored for embedded devices. 
	</p>

	<p>The OS includes a supervisor which allows the use of multi-container applications, provides an on-device API, ensures the containers start and run correctly after each boot, and is able to overcome certain corruption scenarios.
</p>
<p>Finally, what's an article about rockets and space without a launch video?! Thanks to the German Aerospace Center, DLR for sharing the below video on YouTube.

</p>

<p> The paper apex: A new commercial off-the-shelf on-board computer platform for sounding rockets is currently available online, and contains a lot more detail about the project.

</p>
<p> We are super excited to hear about balenaOS going into space for the first time! If you have any feedback or questions feel free to post on the forums where we can share comments with Nico too.
