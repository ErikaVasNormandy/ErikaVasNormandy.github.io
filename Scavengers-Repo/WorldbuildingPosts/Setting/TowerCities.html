  	<h4>Tower Cities</h4>
    <p>The last industrial strongholds of humanity. The Tower Cities that collectively make up Arda Hyperion are massive superstructures built for the purpose of harvesting and refining Warp Crystals in the Exosphere. They are centuries old, living remnants of a time before the Eidolon Crisis, and have survived for so long due to the engineering expertise of previous Atomancer generations. <br/><br/>They are shadows of themselves, having strict regulations on how much electricity can be derived from Atomcrafted sources. While there is arable land courtesy of superstructure technology from the previous Atomancer generation, food production is done via solar power in green houses to maximize efficient spacing. Periodically, harvesting patrols will depart to the surface world to collect other materials or mining ores for manufacturing. \n\n<img src=\"http://www.artofmtg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Paliano-the-High-City-MtG-Arts.jpg\"><\/img>\n<img src=\"https://img1.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/a/6a/city-concept-art-fantasy.jpg\"><\/img>\n</p>
