  	<h4>Tower City Governments</h4>
    <p>...a mix of constitutional monarchies governing their own city-state, and one large alliance reminiscent of the  Delian League (give us money and we will \"protect\" you)\nThere are some settlements that are not in the larger cities, but they are very few and without high populations\nThese city-states do communicate, do trade, and for the most part have avoided major conflicts over resources so far since they're all too caughtup in their own problems</p>
